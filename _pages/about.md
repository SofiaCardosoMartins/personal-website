Hi! I'm Sofia! :wave:

I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering dual-degree Ph.D. student, studying at Carnegie Mellon Univerity and the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto. If you're interested, you can learn more about my research in a separate <a href='/research'>Research</a> tab.

I'm a very pro-active person, always looking to learn and try new things! I look forward to sharing some knowledge with you on this website, so stay tuned!
